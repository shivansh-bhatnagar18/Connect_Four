# Connect_Four
This is basically a web based offline dual player connect four game which I started as my first development project.

Hello, this is Shivansh Bhatnagar from MnC dept. 1 yearite and I have created this game, very close to my heart, in a digital way.

The project is made using simple web design and languages using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

First of all I created the basic structure of  the page including the board, rulebox, new game button, tiles and headings.
In CSS, I worked with alignments, color schemes and basic designs.
JavaScript was used for the logic behind the game implementing a 2D array and applying conditions for matching 4 similar tiles in a verticle, horizontal and diagonal rows
